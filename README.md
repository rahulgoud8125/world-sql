# World Database — SQL Practice

**Project Summary**

This repository contains the work done on the MySQL World Database. The goal was to load the database, understand its tables, run SQL queries, practice JOINs, filters, aggregations, and create a sample view.

**Files**

world db.sql — Original World database dump (tables: country, city, countrylanguage).

sq; quires.sql — SQL queries used for practice and analysis.



What I Did (Steps Implemented)

Imported the world db.sql file into MySQL to create the complete World Database.

Explored tables: country, city, and countrylanguage.

Executed multiple SQL queries such as:

Basic SELECT statements.

Filtering using WHERE, BETWEEN, LIKE.

Sorting using ORDER BY.

Aggregations using COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING.

Performed JOIN operations to connect countries with their cities and languages.

Created a VIEW (example: top populated cities).

Learned how to export SQL output as CSV, PDF, or image.

Verified data using LIMIT, sorting, and grouping methods.
